# LiftyLog: Your Simple Fitness Tracker CLI

## Project Overview
LiftyLog is a straightforward C-based fitness tracker CLI app designed to help you calculate your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate), maintenance calories, and set fitness goals like losing, maintaining, or gaining weight. This project is part of my learning journey with C programming, focusing on basics like input/output, conditionals, and string handling.

## Features
- Simple login authentication (hardcoded for now)
- Inputs user data: weight, height, age, gender, and activity level
- Calculates BMR using the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation
- Calculates maintenance calories based on activity level
- Provides calorie recommendations based on fitness goals (lose, maintain, gain weight)

## How it Works
1. User logs in with username and password.
2. User enters personal details: weight (kg), height (cm), age, gender, and activity level.
3. Program calculates BMR.
4. Program calculates maintenance calories based on activity.
5. User selects a fitness goal.
6. Program outputs recommended daily calorie intake based on the goal.

## Usage

### ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Download or clone the repo.
2. Open the folder in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Compile the code:
4. Run the executable: `gcc -o LiftyLog LiftyLog.c`
5. 5. Follow on-screen prompts to log in and input your details.

## About This Project
This is a beginner-friendly project to practice fundamental C programming concepts such as:
- `scanf` and `printf` for input/output
- `strcmp` for string comparison
- `if-else` for conditional logic
- Basic arithmetic calculations

The project aims to build a functional, useful CLI tool while reinforcing my C skills.

## Future Improvements
- Add persistent user data storage (file/database)
- Enhance login system to support multiple users
- Add a menu for repeated use without re-entering data
- Expand with workout logging and progress tracking features

## Contributing
This is a personal learning project, so no need to contribute, but if you wanna share ideas or improvements, feel free to open issues or fork the repo!
