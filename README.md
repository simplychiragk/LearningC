# LearningC
"Welcome to my learning journey in C programming! This repository contains my earliest works, ranging from basic syntax exercises (such as calculators and loops) to a bit more advanced programs (e.g., file operations, mini-games). Each project shows my improvement as I work through fundamental concepts such as pointers, memory management, and data structures. I've added comments and notes to describe my thinking, errors, and solutions. Open to feedback, contributions, or collaborationâ€”let's learn together! If you're new to C, feel free to fork, modify, or use these as reference. Happy coding!"
