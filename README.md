# 👨‍💻 LearningC: My C Programming Journey

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to **LearningC** — a collection of C programming projects I’ve been working on as I learn and grow in the world of C.

This repo is basically my coding diary. Each project here helped me understand a core concept in C — like loops, conditionals, functions, arrays, and more — by actually building something. Nothing too crazy or advanced, just practical, beginner-friendly stuff.

## 📂 What’s Inside?

Here are some of the projects in this repo:

- **🔢 Simple Calculator**  
  A basic calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and do modulus operations.

- **🔐 Basic Login Page**  
  A console-based login system that checks a username and password — plus, it asks how hyped you are to log in. 😄

- **💸 FinCalcX**  
  A mini financial calculator for figuring out EMI (home, car, personal loans) and SIP future value. Handy if you’re curious about money stuff.

- **🏋️‍♂️ LiftyLog**  
  CLI fitness tracker that calculates your BMR, maintenance calories, and even recommends how much you should eat based on your goals.

- **🎓 Campus Buddy**  
  Helps you manage grades, attendance, and library stuff — because keeping track of everything in college shouldn’t be that hard.

- **🛠️ Other Projects**  
  I’m still learning, so I’ll keep adding more as I go. Expect stuff around pointers, file handling, maybe even mini games 👀

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

Wanna try out the projects? Here's how to get started:

`git clone https://github.com/simplychiragk/LearningC.git`

1. Open any project folder.

2. Check the README.md inside for instructions.

3. Compile and run the C files using gcc or your favorite compiler.

4. That’s it — you’re good to go!

##🙌 Why I Made This
This is my space to learn by doing. Instead of just reading about C, I wanted to build small things that made the concepts stick.
Everything here is written by me, with some help from tutorials and docs. I’ll keep tweaking and adding more projects as I level up.
