# LearningC: My C Programming Journey

## Project Overview
**LearningC** is a collection of my personal C programming projects. It includes various beginner-level programs that Iâ€™ve built as part of my journey to learn and improve my skills in C. Each project is designed to help me understand core concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, arrays, and more, while keeping things simple and accessible.

## Projects in This Repository
This repository includes the following projects:

- **Simple Calculator**: A basic C program for performing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus).
- **Basic Login Page**: A console-based login system that checks a username and password while handling excitement level input.
- **FinCalcX**: A financial calculator that helps in calculating EMI for home, car, and personal loans, as well as SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) future value.
- **LiftyLog**: A command-line fitness tracker that calculates your BMR, estimates maintenance calories, and recommends calorie intake based on your fitness goals.
- **Other Projects**: As I continue to learn, I will be adding more projects related to different C concepts.
