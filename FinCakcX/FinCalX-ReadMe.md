# FinCalcX: Financial Calculator

## Project Overview
**FinCalcX** is a simple financial calculator written in C, created to help calculate **EMIs** for various loans and the **Future Value** of a **SIP** (Systematic Investment Plan). This project is part of my journey to learn C programming, so it uses basic concepts such as `scanf`, `printf`, `switch`, and `if-else` to implement core functionality. As I continue learning, I'll be improving this project further.

## Features
- **Home Loan Calculator**: Calculates EMI for home loans.
- **Car Loan Calculator**: Calculates EMI for car loans.
- **Personal Loan Calculator**: Calculates EMI for personal loans.
- **SIP Calculator**: Calculates the future value of your SIP investment.

## How it Works
- **Home Loan Calculator**: Enter the loan amount, interest rate, and loan tenure (in years), and the program calculates the EMI based on the formula for home loans.
- **Car Loan Calculator**: Similar to the home loan calculator, but for car loans.
- **Personal Loan Calculator**: Calculates EMI for personal loans based on the same formula.
- **SIP Calculator**: Based on the monthly SIP amount, expected annual return rate, and tenure, it calculates the future value of your SIP.

## About This Project
This project is a **beginner-friendly** application that uses the basic C concepts I’ve learned so far. As I'm still in the process of mastering C, I focused on simple concepts like switch statements, and math functions (`pow` for exponential calculations). The goal is to create a useful tool while continuing to learn and improve my skills.

## Contributing
As this is a personal learning project, contributions are not required, but if you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to open an issue or fork the repo. I'm always open to improvements!



Thanks for checking out **FinCalcX**! 😎
