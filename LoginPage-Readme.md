#Basic Login Page
Project Overview
Welcome to the Basic Login Page, one of my first C programming projects! This simple console-based application prompts the user to rate their excitement level and then simulates a login system by checking a username and password. It's a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates basic C concepts like user input, conditionals, and formatted output.

##Features
Excitement Level Input: Users rate their excitement on a scale of 1 to 10, with tailored messages based on their input.
Login System: Users enter a username and password, which are validated against predefined values (username: 1234, password: 5678).
Input Validation: Handles invalid excitement levels and incorrect login credentials with appropriate error messages.
Console-Based Interface: Uses printf and scanf for user interaction.

##Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:

A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
A terminal or IDE that supports C programming (e.g., VS Code)

##Usage
The program starts by welcoming you to the "Basic Login Page."
Enter your excitement level (1–10) when prompted:
1–4: "You are not very excited, but that's okay!"
5–7: "You are moderately excited, that's great!"
8–10: "You are extremely excited, that's awesome!"
Other inputs: "Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 10."
Enter the username (1234) and password (5678).
Based on your input, you'll see:
Correct credentials: "Login successful! Welcome!"
Incorrect password: "Incorrect password. Please try again."
Incorrect username: "Incorrect username. Please try again."
Both incorrect: "Incorrect username and password. Please try again."
If login fails, you'll need to rerun the program to try again.
