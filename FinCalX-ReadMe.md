# FinCalcX: Financial Calculator

## Project Overview
**FinCalcX** is a simple financial calculator written in C, created to help calculate **EMIs** for various loans and the **Future Value** of a **SIP** (Systematic Investment Plan). This project is part of my journey to learn C programming, so it uses basic concepts such as `scanf`, `printf`, `switch`, and `if-else` to implement core functionality. As I continue learning, I'll be improving this project further.

## Features
- **Home Loan Calculator**: Calculates EMI for home loans.
- **Car Loan Calculator**: Calculates EMI for car loans.
- **Personal Loan Calculator**: Calculates EMI for personal loans.
- **SIP Calculator**: Calculates the future value of your SIP investment.

## How it Works
- **Home Loan Calculator**: Enter the loan amount, interest rate, and loan tenure (in years), and the program calculates the EMI based on the formula for home loans.
- **Car Loan Calculator**: Similar to the home loan calculator, but for car loans.
- **Personal Loan Calculator**: Calculates EMI for personal loans based on the same formula.
- **SIP Calculator**: Based on the monthly SIP amount, expected annual return rate, and tenure, it calculates the future value of your SIP.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/simplychiragk/FinCalcX.git
    ```

2. Compile the code using GCC:

    ```bash
    gcc -o FinCalcX main.c -lm
    ```

3. Run the program:

    ```bash
    ./FinCalcX
    ```

4. Follow the prompts to choose the loan or SIP calculator and input the required details.

## About This Project
This project is a **beginner-friendly** application that uses the basic C concepts Iâ€™ve learned so far. As I'm still in the process of mastering C, I focused on simple concepts like conditionals, loops, and math functions (`pow` for exponential calculations). The goal is to create a useful tool while continuing to learn and improve my skills.

## Contributing
As this is a personal learning project, contributions are not required, but if you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to open an issue or fork the repo. I'm always open to improvements!
