# Campus Buddy: Your Ultimate College Helper CLI

## Project Overview
Campus Buddy is a neat CLI app built in C to help college students manage their grades, attendance, and library book tracking â€” all in one place! This project is part of my journey learning C programming and applying basics like input/output, conditionals, and simple arithmetic operations.

## Features
- Course Grade Calculator: Enter marks for 5 subjects and get your total, average, and letter grade.
- Attendance Tracker: Track classes held vs. attended and get a status update with friendly messages.
- Library Manager: Manage your issued books by tracking the days issued, used, and remaining.

## How it Works
1. User enters their name to start.
2. User selects the feature they want from the main menu.
3. Depending on the selection, user inputs relevant data (marks, attendance, or book days).
4. Program calculates and displays summaries and friendly status messages.

## Usage

### ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Download or clone the repo.
2. Open the folder in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Compile the code using a C compiler, e.g.:
   ```bash
   gcc -o campus_buddy campus_buddy.c
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./campus_buddy
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate and use features.

## About This Project
This is a beginner-friendly CLI tool aimed at practicing fundamental C programming concepts like:
- `scanf` and `printf` for input/output
- Using `if-else` for decision making
- Basic arithmetic calculations and validation
- Handling simple user interaction via the command line

## Future Improvements
- Expand features like a To-Do List Manager (removed for now)
- Implementation of Functions

## Contributing
This is a personal learning project. Contributions are welcome. Feel free to fork or open issues for suggestions and improvements!
