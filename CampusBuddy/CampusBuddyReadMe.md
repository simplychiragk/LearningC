# 🌟 Campus Buddy: Your Ultimate College Helper CLI

A simple but powerful command-line app built in C for college students to manage their grades, attendance, and library records — now with better code structure using `switch` and `do-while` loops for a smoother user experience.

## 🧠 Project Overview

**Campus Buddy** is your all-in-one student sidekick! Whether you're tracking your marks, figuring out if you're gonna get that attendance warning, or trying to avoid overdue library fines — this app’s got you. Built entirely in C as part of my learning journey, this project puts together real-world student needs and beginner-friendly programming concepts.

## ✨ Features

- 📚 **Course Grade Calculator**  
  Input marks for 5 subjects and get your total, average, and a fun letter grade with emoji feedback.

- 🗓️ **Attendance Tracker**  
  Enter total and attended classes to see your attendance percentage and whether you're safe… or bunking too much 😬

- 📖 **Library Manager**  
  Keep track of how many days you’ve used an issued book and how many you have left before the librarian starts hunting you down.

- 🔁 **Now with Looping & Clean Menus**  
  Use the main menu as many times as you like, thanks to `do-while`. Plus, we’ve ditched the messy `if-else` for clean `switch-case` logic.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Start the app and enter your name.
2. Choose what you want to do from the main menu.
3. Enter the required info (marks, attendance, or book days).
4. View your report, warnings, or vibes.
5. Loop back to main menu or exit like a boss.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open the project folder in your terminal.
3. Compile the code using:
   ```bash
   gcc -o campus_buddy campus_buddy.c
   ```
4. Run it:
   ```bash
   ./campus_buddy
   ```
5. Follow the prompts and enjoy!

## 🔧 Built With

- `scanf` & `printf` for I/O
- `switch-case` for decision making
- `do-while` loop for menu navigation
- Basic arithmetic & user validation
- Straight-up love for C language 💙

## 🔮 Future Upgrades

- Add a To-Do list / task manager  
- Break code into functions for better modularity
